<h1>Collatz Conjecture</h1>
<p id="description">The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the unsolvable "3n+1" equation, is an infamous math problem in which there are two rules:</br></br>
  If the number is even: divide it by 2 </br>
  If the number is odd: multiply it by 3 and add 1 </br></br>
The Collatz Conjecture states that, regardless of the starting positive integer, repeatedly applying these rules will always eventually lead to the number 1. Despite the seemingly simple nature of this conjecture, it remains unsolved and shrouded in mystery in the world of mathematics.
